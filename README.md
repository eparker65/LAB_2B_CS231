# LAB_2B_CS231

# In this project, the user is prompted with a command to guess a number between 1 and 100. If the user gets the answer wrong, the computer informs them that their guess is either too high or too low depending on what number they guessed. The program involves loops and generates random numbers. At the end of the game, the program tells you congratulations and informs you how many guesses it took to complete the game.
